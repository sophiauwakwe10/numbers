 Here is a brief explanation of how to use the console application to convert numbers to words and words to numbers:

1. When you run the application, you will be prompted to choose an option:
	* Option 1: Convert number to words
	* Option 2: Convert words to number
2. If you choose Option 1, you will be prompted to enter a number. The application will then display the number in words.
3. If you choose Option 2, you will be prompted to enter a word. The application will then display the word as a number.

Note: The application currently only supports positive integers and words for numbers up to 999. It does not support negative numbers or numbers with decimal points. It also does not support words with prefixes such as "k" for thousand or "m" for million.

To convert a number to words, simply enter the number when prompted. To convert a word to a number, enter the word (in lowercase) when prompted. If the word is not a valid number, the application will display an error message.

Here are some examples of how to use the application:

* To convert the number 1234 to words, choose Option 1 and enter 1234 when prompted. The application will display "One Thousand Two Hundred Thirty Four".
* To convert the word "one thousand two hundred thirty four" to a number, choose Option 2 and enter "one thousand two hundred thirty four" when prompted. The application will display 1234.
* To convert the number 0 to words, choose Option 1 and enter 0 when prompted. The application will display "Zero".
